# COVID-19

The pandemic of the novel coronavirus or COVID-19 has not only affected people around the world but brought havoc upon them. 
People are forced to self-isolate to prevent the disease from spreading and that has cause governments across the world to have
lockdowns in many nations around the world.
Amist the lockdown, it is hard for people to find essentail items like groceries and household items as many stores have run out
of them. And during these uncertain and difficult times, finding these amenities should not add more problem to people's already 
stressful situation.
Hence, we are planning to create an app that connects local businesses with customers. The customers will be able to know which
store has all the items they want.
